JPM,"[2025-07-28T10:00:06Z] Opening Bid Unfiltered is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. Midway through 2025, the economy finds itself in a fascinating position. Despite considerable Trump tariff uncertainty and sticky inflation, the US economy continues to expand. The job market is staying solid. Corporate America, as seen by earnings results from Delta (DAL), Levi Strauss (LEVI), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), is performing well on the top and bottom lines. And profit outlooks haven’t been too shabby, either. But that doesn’t mean smooth sailing for the economy into year-end. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk. Several months ago, Slok didn’t rule out a US recession in part because of Trump's tariffs. Meanwhile, the perception of a non-independent Federal Reserve when Trump announces Jerome Powell’s successor could harm the economy and markets. Sløk shares his perspective on these pressing issues for investors and how dynamics may unfold in the economy as we look forward to 2026.
